### Hi there 👋

~~We started this project in March of this year, then Covid19 happened. Our families found themselves in the center of all that is bad due to Covid19. We had to stop and just survive and keep our loved ones safe and healthy. Our struggle is still going on. We'll get to our regular lives and to this project as soon as this SHIT-SHOW is over.~~

Now, after weathering the storm, **we are excited to announce that we have resumed work on this project!** The journey hasn’t been easy, but we’re back and ready to continue building something meaningful. 

At **Sharing Economy Pakistan**, we aim to identify shared problems, build awareness, and foster cooperation using the power of the Internet. Stay tuned as we work towards creating a platform that empowers communities and drives positive change.
